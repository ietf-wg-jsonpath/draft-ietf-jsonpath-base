            <t>Syntax errors in the JSON Path SHOULD be detected before matching is attempted since they do not depend on the JSON document.

            <name>Syntax</name>
            <t>Syntactically, a JSON Path consists of a root selector (<tt>$</tt>), which selects the root node of a JSON document, followed by a possibly empty sequence of <em>matchers</em>.
            </t>
            <sourcecode type="abnf">
json-path = root-selector *matcher
root-selector = %x24               ; $ selects document root node
            </sourcecode>
            <t>The syntax and semantics of each matcher is defined below.
            </t>
         </section>
         <section numbered="true" toc="default">
            <name>Semantics</name>
            <t>The root selector <tt>$</tt> not only selects the root node of the input document, but it also produces as output a list consisting of one node: the input document.
            </t>
            <t>A matcher may match a node and, if it matches, may then select zero or more descendants of the node for further processing.
               But there's more to it than this: each matcher acts on a list of nodes and produces a list of nodes, as follows.
            </t>
            <t>After the root selector, the remainder of the JSON Path is processed by passing lists of nodes from one matcher to the next ending up with a list of nodes which is the result of
               matching the JSON Path to the input JSON document.
            </t>
            <t>Each matcher acts on its input list of nodes as follows. For each node in the list, the matcher may or may not match the node. If the matcher
               matches the node, it selects zero or more descendants of the node.
               The output list of nodes of a matcher is the concatenation of the lists of selected descendents for each input node. 
            </t>
            <t>A specific, non-normative example will make this clearer. Suppose the input document is: <tt>{"a":[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"b":2}]}</tt>. As we will see later, the JSON Path
               <tt>$.a[*].b</tt> selects the following list of nodes: <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>. Let's walk through this in detail.
            </t>
            <t>The JSON Path consists of <tt>$</tt> followed by three matchers: <tt>.a</tt>, <tt>[*]</tt>, and <tt>.b</tt>.
            </t>
            <t>Firstly, <tt>$</tt> matches the input document and selects the root node which is the input document. So the result is a list consisting of just the root node.
            </t>
            <t>Next, <tt>.a</tt> matches any input node of type object and selects any value of the input node corresponding to the key <tt>"a"</tt>.
               The result is again a list of one node: <tt>[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"b":2}]</tt>.
            </t>
            <t>Next, <tt>[*]</tt> matches any input node which is an array and selects all the elements of the input node.
               The result is a list of three nodes: <tt>{"b":0}</tt>, <tt>{"b":1}</tt>, and <tt>{"b":2}</tt>. 
            </t>
            <t>Finally, <tt>.b</tt> matches any input node of type object and selects any value of the input node corresponding to the key <tt>"b"</tt>.
               The result is the concatenation of three lists each of length one containing <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>, respectively.
            </t>
            <t>As a consequence of this approach, if any of the matchers matches no nodes, then the whole JSON Path matches no nodes.
            </t>
            <t>In what follows, the semantics of each matcher are defined for each type of node.
