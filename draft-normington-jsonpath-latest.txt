1.  Introduction

   JSONPath was introduced by Stefan Goessner as a simple form of XPath
   for JSON.  See his original article [Goessner].

   JSON is defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  ABNF Syntax

   The syntax in this document conforms to ABNF as defined by RFC 5234
   [RFC5234].

2.  JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

Internet-Draft   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Path        July 2020


2.1.  Overview

   A JSONPath is a string which matches zero or more nodes of any JSON
   document.  A valid JSONPath conforms to the ABNF syntax defined by
   this document.

2.2.  Terminology

   A JSON document is logically a tree of nodes with the document as the
   root node of the tree.

   Each node holds a JSON value (as defined by RFC 8259 [RFC8259]) of
   one of the types object, array, number, string, or one of the
   literals "true", "false", or "null".  The type of the JSON value held
   by a node is sometimes referred to as the type of the node.

   The descendants of a node are taken to include the node itself and
   the descendants of any children of the node.

2.3.  Implementation

   An implementation of this specification, from now on referred to
   simply as "an implementation", SHOULD takes two inputs, a JSONPath
   and a JSON document, and produce a possibly empty list of nodes of
   the JSON document which match the JSONPath or an error (but not
   both).

   If there is no matching node and no error has occurred, an
   implementation MUST return an empty list of nodes.

   Syntax errors in the JSONPath SHOULD be detected before matching is
   attempted since they do not depend on the JSON document.  Therefore,
   an implementation SHOULD take a JSONPath and produce an optional
   syntax error and then, if and only if an error was not produced,
   SHOULD take a JSON document and produce a list of matches or an error
   (but not both).

   Alternatively, an implementation MAY take a JSONPath and a JSON
   document and produce a list of matches or an optional error (but not
   both).

   For any implementation, if a syntactically invalid JSONPath is
   provided, the implementation MUST return an error.

   If a syntactially invalid JSON document is provided, any
   implementation SHOULD return an error.

2.4.  Syntax

   Syntactically, a JSONPath consists of a root selector ("$"), which
   selects the root node of a JSON document, followed by a possibly
   empty sequence of _matchers_.

   json-path = root-selector *matcher
   root-selector = %x24               ; $ selects document root node

   The syntax and semantics of each matcher is defined below.

2.5.  Semantics

   The root selector "$" not only selects the root node of the input
   document, but it produces as output a list consisting of one node:
   the input document.

   After the root selector, the remainder of the JSONPath passes lists
   of nodes from one matcher to the next ending up with a list of nodes
   which is the result of matching the JSONPath to the input JSON
   document.

   Each matcher acts on its input list of nodes as follows.  For each
   node in the list, the matcher matches zero or more descendants of the
   node.  The output list of nodes of a matcher is the concatenation of
   the lists of matching descendents for each input node.

   A specific, non-normative example will make this clearer.  Suppose
   the input document is: "{"a":[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"b":2}]}".  As we will
   see later, the JSONPath "$.a[*].b" produces the following list of
   matching nodes: "0", "1", "2".  Let's walk through this in detail.

   The JSONPath consists of "$" followed by three matchers: ".a", "[*]",
   and ".b".

   Firstly, "$" matches the input document and produces a list of one
   node: the input document.

   Next, ".a" matches any values of input nodes (which are objects)
   corresponding to the key ""a"".  The result is again a list of one
   node: "[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"b":2}]".

   Next, "[*]" matches all the elements of input nodes which are arrays.
   The result is a list of three nodes: "{"b":0}", "{"b":1}", and
   "{"b":2}".

   Finally, ".b" matches any values of input nodes (which are objects)
   corresponding to the key ""b"".  The result is the concatenation of
   three lists each of length one containing "0", "1", "2",
   respectively.

   As a consequence of this approach, if any of the matchers matches no
   nodes, then the whole JSONPath matches no nodes.

   In what follows, the semantics of each matcher are defined for each
   type of node.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section gives security considerations, as required by RFC 3552
   [RFC3552].

5.  Alternatives

   An analogous standard, JSON Pointer, is provided by RFC 6901
   [RFC6901].
