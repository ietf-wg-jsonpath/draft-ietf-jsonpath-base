1.  Introduction

   JSONPath was introduced by Stefan Goessner as a simple form of XPath
   for JSON.  See his original article [Goessner].

   JSON is defined by [RFC8259].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  ABNF Syntax

   The syntax in this document conforms to ABNF as defined by [RFC5234].

   ABNF terminal values in this document define Unicode code points
   rather than their UTF-8 encoding.  For example, the Unicode PLACE OF
   INTEREST SIGN (U+2318) would be defined in ABNF as "%x2318".

2.  JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

2.1.  Overview

   A JSONPath is a string which selects zero or more nodes of a piece of
   JSON.  A valid JSONPath conforms to the ABNF syntax defined by this
   document.

   A JSONPath MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  To parse a JSONPath
   according to the grammar in this document, its UTF-8 form SHOULD
   first be decoded into Unicode code points as described in [RFC3629].

2.2.  Terminology

   A JSON value is logically a tree of nodes.

   Each node holds a JSON value (as defined by [RFC8259]) of one of the
   types object, array, number, string, or one of the literals "true",
   "false", or "null".  The type of the JSON value held by a node is
   sometimes referred to as the type of the node.

2.3.  Implementation

   An implementation of this specification, from now on referred to
   simply as "an implementation", SHOULD takes two inputs, a JSONPath
   and a JSON value, and produce a possibly empty list of nodes of the
   JSON value which are selected by the JSONPath or an error (but not
   both).

   If no node is selected and no error has occurred, an implementation
   MUST return an empty list of nodes.

   Syntax errors in the JSONPath SHOULD be detected before selection is
   attempted since these errors do not depend on the JSON value.
   Therefore, an implementation SHOULD take a JSONPath and produce an
   optional syntax error and then, if and only if an error was not
   produced, SHOULD take a JSON value and produce a list of nodes or an
   error (but not both).

   Alternatively, an implementation MAY take a JSONPath and a JSON value
   and produce a list of nodes or an optional error (but not both).

   For any implementation, if a syntactically invalid JSONPath is
   provided, the implementation MUST return an error.

   If a syntactially invalid JSON value is provided, any implementation
   SHOULD return an error.

2.4.  Syntax

   Syntactically, a JSONPath consists of a root selector ("$"), which
   selects the root node of a JSON value, followed by a possibly empty
   sequence of _selectors_.

   json-path = root-selector *selector
   root-selector = %x24               ; $ selects document root node

   The syntax and semantics of each selector is defined below.

2.5.  Semantics

   The root selector "$" not only selects the root node of the input
   document, but it also produces as output a list consisting of one
   node: the input document.

   A selector may select zero or more nodes for further processing.  A
   syntactically valid selector MUST NOT produce errors.  This means
   that some operations which might be considered erroneous, such as
   indexing beyond the end of an array, simply result in fewer nodes
   being selected.

   But a selector doesn't just act on a single node: each selector acts
   on a list of nodes and produces a list of nodes, as follows.

   After the root selector, the remainder of the JSONPath is processed
   by passing lists of nodes from one selector to the next ending up
   with a list of nodes which is the result of applying the JSONPath to
   the input JSON value.

   Each selector acts on its input list of nodes as follows.  For each
   node in the list, the selector selects zero or more nodes, each of
   which is a descendant of the node or the node itself.  The output
   list of nodes of a selector is the concatenation of the lists of
   selected nodes for each input node.

   A specific, non-normative example will make this clearer.  Suppose
   the input document is: "{"a":[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"c":2}]}".  As we will
   see later, the JSONPath "$.a[*].b" selects the following list of
   nodes: "0", "1".  Let's walk through this in detail.

   The JSONPath consists of "$" followed by three selectors: ".a",
   "[*]", and ".b".

   Firstly, "$" selects the root node which is the input document.  So
   the result is a list consisting of just the root node.

   Next, ".a" selects from any input node of type object and selects any
   value of the input node corresponding to the key ""a"".  The result
   is again a list of one node: "[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"c":2}]".

   Next, "[*]" selects from any input node which is an array and selects
   all the elements of the input node.  The result is a list of three
   nodes: "{"b":0}", "{"b":1}", and "{"c":2}".

   Finally, ".b" selects from any input node of type object with a key
   "b" and selects the value of the input node corresponding to that
   key.  The result is a list containing "0", "1".  This is the
   concatenation of three lists, two of length one containing "0", "1",
   respectively, and one of length zero.

   As a consequence of this approach, if any of the selectors selects no
   nodes, then the whole JSONPath selects no nodes.

   In what follows, the semantics of each selector are defined for each
   type of node.

2.6.  Selectors

2.6.1.  Dot Child Selector

Syntax

   A dot child selector has a key known as a dot child name or a single
   asterisk ("*").

   A dot child name corresponds to a name in a JSON object.

Internet-Draft   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Path    November 2020


   selector = dot-child              ; see below for alternatives
   dot-child = %x2E dot-child-name / ; .<dot-child-name>
               %x2E %x2A             ; .*
   dot-child-name = 1*(
                      %x2D /         ; -
                      DIGIT /
                      ALPHA /
                      %x5F /         ; _
                      %x80-10FFFF    ; any non-ASCII Unicode character
                    )
   DIGIT =  %x30-39                  ; 0-9
   ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A         ; A-Z / a-z

   More general child names, such as the empty string, are supported by
   "Union Child" (Section 2.6.2.3).

   Note that the "dot-child-name" rule follows the philosophy of JSON
   strings and is allowed to contain bit sequences that cannot encode
   Unicode characters (a single unpaired UTF-16 surrogate, for example).
   The behaviour of an implementation is undefined for child names which
   do not encode Unicode characters.

Semantics

   A dot child name which is not a single asterisk ("*") is considered
   to have a key.  It selects the value corresponding to the key from
   any object node.  It selects no nodes from a node which is not an
   object.

   The key of a dot child name is the sequence of Unicode characters
   contained in that name.

   A dot child name consisting of a single asterisk is a wild card.  It
   selects all the values of any object node.  It also selects all the
   elements of any array node.  It selects no nodes from number, string,
   or literal nodes.

2.6.2.  Union Selector

2.6.2.1.  Syntax

   A union selector consists of one or more union elements.

   selector =/ union
   union = %x5B ws union-elements ws %x5D ; [...]
   ws = *%x20                             ; zero or more spaces
   union-elements = union-element /
                    union-element ws %x2C ws union-elements
                                          ; ,-separated list

2.6.2.2.  Semantics

   A union selects any node which is selected by at least one of the
   union selectors and selects the concatenation of the lists (in the
   order of the selectors) of nodes selected by the union elements.

2.6.2.3.  Child

Syntax

   A child is a quoted string.

   Notes: 1. double-quoted strings follow JSON in [RFC8259].  Single-
   quoted strings follow an analogous pattern. 2.  "HEXDIG" includes A-F
   and a-f.

Semantics

   If the child is a quoted string, the string MUST be converted to a
   key by removing the surrounding quotes and replacing each escape
   sequence with its equivalent Unicode character, as in the table
   below:

   The child selects the value corresponding to the key from any object
   node with the key as a name.  It selects no nodes from a node which
   is not an object.

2.6.2.4.  Array Selector

Syntax

   An array selector selects zero or more elements of an array node.  An
   array selector takes the form of an index, which selects at most one
   element, or a slice, which selects zero or more elements.

   union-element =/ array-index / array-slice

   An array index is an integer (in base 10).

   array-index = integer

   integer = ["-"] ("0" / (DIGIT1 *DIGIT))
                               ; optional - followed by 0 or
                               ; sequence of digits with no leading zero
   DIGIT1 = %x31-39            ; non-zero digit

Internet-Draft   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Path    November 2020


   Note: the syntax does not allow integers with leading zeros such as
   "01" and "-01".

   An array slice consists of three optional integers (in base 10)
   separated by colons.

   array-slice = [ start ] ws ":" ws [ end ]
                      [ ws ":" ws [ step ] ]
   start = integer
   end = integer
   step = integer

   Note: the array slices ":" and "::" are both syntactically valid, as
   are ":2:2", "2::2", and "2:4:".

Semantics

Informal Introduction

   This section is non-normative.

   Array indexing is a way of selecting a particular element of an array
   using a 0-based index.  For example, the expression "[0]" selects the
   first element of a non-empty array.

   Negative indices index from the end of an array.  For example, the
   expression "[-2]" selects the last but one element of an array with
   at least two elements.

   Array slicing is inspired by the behaviour of the
   "Array.prototype.slice" method of the JavaScript language as defined
   by the ECMA-262 standard [ECMA-262], with the addition of the "step"
   parameter, which is inspired by the Python slice expression.

   The array slice expression "[start:end:step]" selects elements at
   indices starting at "start", incrementing by "step", and ending with
   "end" (which is itself excluded).  So, for example, the expression
   "[1:3]" (where "step" defaults to "1") selects elements with indices
   "1" and "2" (in that order) whereas "[1:5:2]" selects elements with
   indices "1" and "3".

   When "step" is negative, elements are selected in reverse order.
   Thus, for example, "[5:1:-2]" selects elements with indices "5" and
   "3", in that order and "[::-1]" selects all the elements of an array
   in reverse order.

   When "step" is "0", no elements are selected.  This is the one case
   which differs from the behaviour of Python, which raises an error in
   this case.

   The following section specifies the behaviour fully, without
   depending on JavaScript or Python behaviour.

Detailed Semantics

   An array selector is either an array slice or an array index, which
   is defined in terms of an array slice.

   A slice expression selects a subset of the elements of the input
   array, in the same order as the array or the reverse order, depending
   on the sign of the "step" parameter.  It selects no nodes from a node
   which is not an array.

   A slice is defined by the two slice parameters, "start" and "end",
   and an iteration delta, "step".  Each of these parameters is
   optional. "len" is the length of the input array.

   The default value for "step" is "1".  The default values for "start"
   and "end" depend on the sign of "step", as follows:

                    +===========+=========+==========+
                    | Condition | start   | end      |
                    +===========+=========+==========+
                    | step >= 0 | 0       | len      |
                    +-----------+---------+----------+
                    | step < 0  | len - 1 | -len - 1 |
                    +-----------+---------+----------+

                       Table 2: Default array slice
                           start and end values

   Slice expression parameters "start" and "end" are not directly usable
   as slice bounds and must first be normalized.  Normalization is
   defined as:

   FUNCTION Normalize(i):
     IF i >= 0 THEN
       RETURN i
     ELSE
       RETURN len + i
     END IF

   The result of the array indexing expression "[i]" is defined to be
   the result of the array slicing expression "[i:Normalize(i)+1:1]".

   Slice expression parameters "start" and "end" are used to derive
   slice bounds "lower" and "upper".  The direction of the iteration,
   defined by the sign of "step", determines which of the parameters is
   the lower bound and which is the upper bound:

   FUNCTION Bounds(start, end, step, len):
     n_start = Normalize(start)
     n_end = Normalize(end)

     IF step >= 0 THEN
       lower = MIN(MAX(n_start, 0), len)
       upper = MIN(MAX(n_end, 0), len)
     ELSE
       upper = MIN(MAX(n_start, -1), len-1)
       lower = MIN(MAX(n_end, -1), len-1)
     END IF

     RETURN (lower, upper)

   The slice expression selects elements with indices between the lower
   and upper bounds.  In the following pseudocode, the "a(i)" construct
   expresses the 0-based indexing operation on the underlying array.

   IF step > 0 THEN

     i = lower
     WHILE i < upper:
       SELECT a(i)
       i = i + step
     END WHILE

   ELSE if step < 0 THEN

     i = upper
     WHILE lower < i:
       SELECT a(i)
       i = i + step
     END WHILE

   END IF

   When "step = 0", no elements are selected and the result array is
   empty.

   An implementation MUST raise an error if any of the slice expression
   parameters does not fit in the implementation's representation of an
   integer.  If a successfully parsed slice expression is evaluated
   against an array whose size doesn't fit in the implementation's
   representation of an integer, the implementation MUST raise an error.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

   All drafts are required to have an IANA considerations section (see
   Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs
   [RFC5226] for a guide).  If the draft does not require IANA to do
   anything, the section contains an explicit statement that this is the
   case (as above).  If there are no requirements for IANA, the section
   will be removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC Editor.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section gives security considerations, as required by [RFC3552].

5.  Alternatives

   An analogous standard, JSON Pointer, is provided by [RFC6901].
