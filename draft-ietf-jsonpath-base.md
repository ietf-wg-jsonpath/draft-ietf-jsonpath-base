--- abstract

JSONPath defines a string syntax for selecting and extracting values
within a JSON (RFC 8259) value.

# Introduction

JSON {{-json}} is a popular representation
format for structured data values.
JSONPath defines a string syntax for identifying values
within a JSON value.

JSONPath is not intended as a replacement for, but as a more powerful
companion to, JSON Pointer {{RFC6901}}. See {{json-pointer}}.

## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as ABNF,
as described in {{-abnf}}.
ABNF terminal values in this document define Unicode code points rather than
their UTF-8 encoding.
For example, the Unicode PLACE OF INTEREST SIGN (U+2318) would be defined
in ABNF as `%x2318`.

The terminology of {{-json}} applies except where clarified below.
The terms "Primitive" and "Structured" are used to group
the types as in {{Section 1 of -json}}.
Definitions for "Object", "Array", "Number", and "String" remain
unchanged.
Importantly "object" and "array" in particular do not take on a
generic meaning, such as they would in a general programming context.

Additional terms used in this specification are defined below.

Value:
: As per {{-json}}, a structure complying to the generic data model of JSON, i.e.,
  composed of components such as structured values, namely JSON objects and arrays, and
  primitive data, namely numbers and text strings as well as the special
  values null, true, and false.

Type:
: As per {{-json}}, one of the six JSON types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, arrays).

Member:
: A name/value pair in an object.  (Not itself a value.)

Name:
: The name in a name/value pair constituting a member.  (Also known as <!-- should we make it clear that names are (Unicode) strings? -->
  "key", "tag", or "label".)
  This is also used in {{-json}}, but that specification does not
  formally define it.
  It is included here for completeness.

Element:
: A value in an array. (Not to be confused with XML element.)

Index:
: A non-negative integer that identifies a specific element in an array.
  Note that the term _indexing_ is also used for accessing elements
  using negative integers ({{index-semantics}}), and for accessing
  member values in an object using their member name.

Query:
: Short name for JSONPath expression.

Argument:
: Short name for the value a JSONPath expression is applied to.

Node:
: The pair of a value along with its location within the argument.

Root Node:
: The unique node whose value is the entire argument.

Children (of a node):
: If the node is an array, each of its elements,
  or if the node is an object, each of its member values (but not its
  member names). If the node is neither an array nor an object, it has no children.

Descendants (of a node):
: The children of the node, together with the children of its children, and so forth
  recursively. More formally, the descendants relation between nodes is the transitive
  closure of the children relation.

Nodelist:
: A list of nodes.  <!-- ordered list?  Maybe TBD by issues #27 and #60 -->
  The output of applying a query to an argument is manifested as a list of nodes.
  While this list can be represented in JSON, e.g. as an array, the
  nodelist is an abstract concept unrelated to JSON values.

Normalized Path:
: A simple form of JSONPath expression that identifies a node by
  providing a query that results in exactly that node.  Similar
  to, but syntactically different from, a JSON Pointer {{-pointer}}.

Unicode Scalar Value:
: Any Unicode {{UNICODE}} code point except high-surrogate and low-surrogate code points.
  In other words, integers in either of the inclusive base 16 ranges 0 to D7FF and
  E000 to 10FFFF. JSON values of type string are sequences of Unicode scalar values.

Singular Path:
: A JSONPath expression built from selectors which each select at most one node.

For the purposes of this specification, a value as defined by
{{-json}} is also viewed as a tree of nodes.
Each node, in turn, holds a value.
Further nodes within each value are the elements of arrays and the
member values of objects and are themselves values.
(The type of the value held by a node
may also be referred to as the type of the node.)

A query is applied to an argument, and the output is a nodelist.

## History

This document picks up {{{Stefan Gössner}}}'s popular JSONPath proposal
dated 2007-02-21 {{JSONPath-orig}} and provides a normative definition
for it.

{{inspired-by-xpath}} describes how JSONPath was inspired by XML's XPath
[XPath].

JSONPath was intended as a light-weight companion to JSON
implementations on platforms such as PHP and JavaScript, so instead of
defining its own expression language like XPath did, JSONPath
delegated this to the expression language of the platform.
While the languages in which JSONPath is used do have significant
commonalities, over time this caused non-portability of JSONPath
expressions between the ensuing platform-specific dialects.

The present specification intends to remove platform dependencies and
serve as a common JSONPath specification that can be used across
platforms.  Obviously, this means that backwards compatibility could
not always be achieved; a design principle of this specification is to
go with a "consensus" between implementations even if it is rough, as
long as that does not jeopardize the objective of obtaining a usable,
stable JSON query language.

## Overview of JSONPath Expressions {#overview}

JSONPath expressions are applied to a JSON value, the *argument*.
Within the JSONPath expression, the abstract name `$` is used to refer
to the *root node* of the argument, i.e., to the argument as a whole.

JSONPath expressions can use the *dot notation*

~~~~
$.store.book[0].title
~~~~

or the more general *bracket notation*

~~~~
$['store']['book'][0]['title']
~~~~

to build paths that are input to a JSONPath implementation.

JSONPath allows the wildcard symbol `*` to select any member of an
object or any element of an array ({{wildcard}}).
The descendant operators (which start with `..`) select some or all of the descendants ({{descendant-selectors}}) of a node.
The array slice
syntax `[start:end:step]` allows selecting a regular selection of an
element from an array, giving a start position, an end position, and
possibly a step value that moves the position from the start to the
end ({{slice}}).

Filter expressions are supported via the syntax `?(<boolean expr>)` as in

~~~~
$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title
~~~~

{{tbl-overview}} provides a quick overview of the JSONPath syntax elements.

# JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

## Overview {#synsem-overview}

A JSONPath query is a string which selects zero or more nodes of a JSON value.

A query MUST be encoded using UTF-8.
The grammar for queries given in this document assumes that its UTF-8 form is first decoded into
Unicode code points as described
in {{RFC3629}}; implementation approaches that lead to an equivalent
result are possible.

A string to be used as a JSONPath query needs to be *well-formed* and
*valid*.
A string is a well-formed JSONPath query if it conforms to the ABNF syntax in this document.
A well-formed JSONPath query is valid if it also fulfills all semantic
requirements posed by this document.

To be valid, integer numbers in the JSONPath query that are relevant
to the JSONPath processing (e.g., index values and steps) MUST be
within the range of exact values defined in I-JSON {{-i-json}}, namely
within the interval \[-(2<sup>53</sup>)+1, (2<sup>53</sup>)-1]).

To be valid, strings on the right-hand side of the `=~` regex matching
operator need to conform to {{-iregexp}}.

The well-formedness and the validity of JSONPath queries are independent of
the JSON value the query is applied to; no further errors relating to the
well-formedness and the validity of a JSONPath query can be
raised during application of the query to a value.

Obviously, an implementation can still fail when executing a JSONPath
query, e.g., because of resource depletion, but this is not modeled in
the present specification.  However, the implementation MUST NOT
silently malfunction.  Specifically, if a valid JSONPath query is
evaluated against a structured value whose size doesn't fit in the
range of exact values, interfering with the correct interpretation of
the query, the implementation MUST provide an indication of overflow.

(Readers familiar with the HTTP error model may be reminded of 400
type errors when pondering well-formedness and validity, while
resource depletion and related errors are comparable to 500 type
errors.)

The JSON value the JSONPath query is applied to is, by definition, a valid JSON value.
The parsing of a JSON text into a JSON value and what happens if a JSON
text does not represent valid JSON are not defined by this specification.
{{Sections 4 and 8 of -json}} identify specific situations that may
conform to the grammar for JSON texts but are not interoperable uses
of JSON, for instance as they may cause unpredictable behavior.
The present specification does not attempt to define predictable
behavior for JSONPath queries in these situations.
(Note that another warning about interoperability, in {{Section 2 of
-json}}, at the time of writing is generally considered to be overtaken
by events and causes no issues with the present specification.)

Specifically, the "Semantics" subsections of Sections {{<dot-selector}},
{{<wildcard}}, {{<index-selector}}, {{<index-wildcard-selector}},
{{<filter-selector}}, and {{<descendant-selectors}} describe behavior that
turns unpredictable when the JSON value for one of the objects
under consideration was constructed out of JSON text that exhibits
multiple members for a single object that share the same member name
("duplicate names", see {{Section 4 of -json}}).
Also, matching ({{selectors}}) and comparing
({{comparisons}} in Section {{<filter-selector}}) of strings assumes these
strings are sequences of Unicode scalar values, turning unpredictable
if they aren't ({{Section 8.2 of -json}}).

## Syntax

Syntactically, a JSONPath query consists of a root selector (`$`), which
stands for a nodelist that contains the root node of the argument,
followed by a possibly empty sequence of *selectors*.

~~~~ abnf
json-path = root-selector *(S (dot-selector        /
                               dot-wild-selector   /
                               index-selector      /
                               index-wild-selector /
                               slice-selector      /
                               filter-selector     /
                               list-selector       /
                               descendant-selector))
~~~~

The syntax and semantics of each selector is defined below.


## Semantics

In this specification, the semantics of a JSONPath query define the
required results and do not prescribe the internal workings of an
implementation.

The semantics are that a valid query is executed against a value,
the *argument*, and produces a list of zero or more nodes of the value.

The query is a sequence of zero or more *selectors*, each of
which is applied to the result of the previous selector and provides
input to the next selector.
These results and inputs take the form of a *nodelist*, i.e., a
sequence of zero or more nodes.

The nodelist presented to the first selector contains a single node,
the argument.
The nodelist resulting from the last selector is presented as the
result of the query; depending on the specific API, it might be
presented as an array of the JSON values at the nodes, an array of
Normalized Paths referencing the nodes, or both — or some other
representation as desired by the implementation.
Note that the API must be capable of presenting an empty nodelist as
the result of the query.

A selector performs its function on each of the nodes in its input
nodelist, during such a function execution, such a node is referred to
as the "current node".  Each of these function executions produces a
nodelist, which are then concatenated to produce
the result of the selector. A node may be selected more than once and
appear that number of times in the nodelist. Duplicate nodes are not removed.

The processing within a selector may execute nested queries,
which conform to the semantics defined here.
Typically, the argument to that query will be the current node of the
selector or a set of nodes subordinate to that current node.

A syntactically valid selector MUST NOT produce errors.
This means that some
operations that might be considered erroneous, such as indexing beyond the
end of an array,
simply result in fewer nodes being selected.

Consider this example. With the argument `{"a":[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"c":2}]}`, the
query `$.a[*].b` selects the following list of nodes: `0`, `1`
(denoted here by their value).

The query consists of `$` followed by three selectors: `.a`, `[*]`, and `.b`.

Firstly, `$` selects the root node which is the argument.
So the result is a list consisting of just the root node.

Next, `.a` selects from any input node of type object and selects the
node of any
member value of the input
node corresponding to the member name `"a"`.
The result is again a list of one node: `[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"c":2}]`.

Next, `[*]` selects from an input node of type array all its elements
(if the input node were of type object, it would select all its member
values, but not the member names).
The result is a list of three nodes: `{"b":0}`, `{"b":1}`, and `{"c":2}`.

Finally, `.b` selects from any input node of type object with a member name
`b` and selects the node of the member value of the input node corresponding to that name.
The result is a list containing `0`, `1`.
This is the concatenation of three lists, two of length one containing
`0`, `1`, respectively, and one of length zero.

As a consequence of this approach, if any of the selectors selects no nodes,
then the whole query selects no nodes.

In what follows, the semantics of each selector are defined for each type
of node.


## Selectors

A JSONPath query consists of a sequence of selectors. Valid selectors are

  * Root selector `$` (used at the start of a query and in expressions)
  * Dot selector `.<name>`, used with object member names exclusively
  * Dot wildcard selector `.*`
  * Index selector `[<index>]`, where `<index>` is either a (possibly
    negative, see {{index-semantics}}) array index or an object member name
  * Index wildcard selector `[*]`
  * Array slice selector `[<start>:<end>:<step>]`, where the optional
    values `<start>`, `<end>`, and `<step>` are integer literals
  * List selector `[<sel1>,<sel2>,...,<selN>]`, holding a comma
    separated list of index and slice selectors
  * Filter selector `[?(<expr>)]`
  * Current item selector `@` (used in expressions)
  * Descendants selectors starting with a double dot `..`

Note that processing the dot selector, string-valued index selector,
and filter selector all potentially require matching strings against
strings, with those strings coming from the JSONPath and from member
names and string values in the JSON to which it is being applied.
Two strings MUST be considered equal if and only if they are identical
sequences of Unicode scalar values. In other words, normalization operations
MUST NOT be applied to either the string from the JSONPath or from the JSON
prior to comparison.

### Root Selector

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

Every valid JSONPath query MUST begin with the root selector `$`.

~~~~

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

The root selector `$` selects the root node of the argument
and produces a nodelist consisting of that root node.

### Dot Selector

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

A dot selector starts with a dot `.` followed by an object's member name.

~~~~ abnf
dot-selector    = "." dot-member-name
dot-member-name = name-first *name-char
name-first      =
                      ALPHA /
                      "_"   /           ; _
                      %x80-10FFFF       ; any non-ASCII Unicode character
name-char = DIGIT / name-first

DIGIT           =  %x30-39              ; 0-9
ALPHA           =  %x41-5A / %x61-7A    ; A-Z / a-z
~~~~

Member names containing characters other than allowed by
`dot-selector` — such as space (U+0020), minus (U+002D), or dot (U+002E)
characters — MUST NOT be used with the `dot-selector`.
(Such member names can be addressed by the
`index-selector` instead.)

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

The `dot-selector` selects the node of the member value corresponding
to the member name from any JSON object in its input nodelist.

It selects no nodes from any other JSON value.

#### Examples
{: unnumbered}

JSON:

    {"j": {"k": 3}}

Queries:

| Query | Result | Result Paths | Comment |
| :---: | ------ | :----------: | ------- |
| `$.j`   | `{"k": 3}` | `$['j']`      | Named value of an object      |
| `$.j.k` | `3`        | `$['j']['k']` | Named value in nested object  |

### Dot Wildcard Selector {#wildcard}

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

The dot wildcard selector has the form `.*` as defined in the
following syntax:

~~~~ abnf
dot-wild-selector    = "." wildcard       ;  dot followed by asterisk
wildcard             = "*"
~~~~

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

A `dot-wild-selector` acts as a wildcard by selecting the nodes of
all member values of an object in its input nodelist as well as all
element nodes of an array in its input nodelist.

Applying the `dot-wild-selector` to a primitive JSON value (a number,
a string, `true`, `false`, or `null`) selects no node.

#### Examples
{: unnumbered}

JSON:

    {
      "o": {"j": 1, "k": 2},
      "a": [5, 3]
    }

Queries:

| Query | Result | Result Paths | Comment |
| :---: | ------ | :----------: | ------- |
| `$.o.*` | `1` <br> `2` | `$['o']['j']` <br> `$['o']['k']` | Object values      |
| `$.o.*` | `2` <br> `1` | `$['o']['k']` <br> `$['o']['j']` | Alternative result |
| `$.a.*` | `5` <br> `3` | `$['a'][0]` <br> `$['a'][1]`     | Array members      |
{: title="Dot wildcard selector examples"}

### Index Selector

#### Syntax {#syntax-index}
{: unnumbered}

An index selector `[<index>]` addresses at most one object member value or at most one array element value.

~~~~ abnf
index-selector      = "[" S (quoted-member-name / element-index) S "]"
~~~~

Applying the `index-selector` to an object value in its input nodelist, a
`quoted-member-name` string is required to select the corresponding
member value.
In contrast to JSON,
the JSONPath syntax allows strings to be enclosed in _single_ or _double_ quotes.

~~~~

Applying the `index-selector` to an array, a numerical `element-index`
is required to select the corresponding
element. JSONPath allows it to be negative (see {{index-semantics}}).

~~~~ abnf
element-index   = int                             ; decimal integer

~~~~

Notes:
1. `double-quoted` strings follow the JSON string syntax ({{Section 7 of RFC8259}});
   `single-quoted` strings follow an analogous pattern ({{syntax-index}}).
2. An `element-index` is an integer (in base 10, as in JSON numbers).
3. As in JSON numbers, the syntax does not allow octal-like integers with leading zeros such as `01` or `-01`.

#### Semantics {#index-semantics}
{: unnumbered}

A `quoted-member-name` string MUST be converted to a
member name by removing the surrounding quotes and
replacing each escape sequence with its equivalent Unicode character, as
in the table below:

The `index-selector` applied with a `quoted-member-name` to an object
selects the node of the corresponding member value from it, if and only if that object has a member with that name.
Nothing is selected from a value that is not a object.

The `index-selector` applied with an `element-index` to an array selects an array element using a zero-based index.
For example, selector `[0]` selects the first and selector `[4]` the fifth element of a sufficiently long array.
Nothing is selected, and it is not an error, if the index lies outside the range of the array. Nothing is selected from a value that is not an array.

A negative `element-index` counts from the array end.
For example, selector `[-1]` selects the last and selector `[-2]` selects the penultimate element of an array with at least two elements.
As with non-negative indexes, it is not an error if such an element does
not exist; this simply means that no element is selected.

### Index Wildcard Selector

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

The index wildcard selector has the form `[*]`.

~~~~ abnf
index-wild-selector    = "[" wildcard "]"  ;  asterisk enclosed by brackets

#### Semantics

An `index-wild-selector`
selects the nodes of all member values of an object as well as of all elements of an
array.

Applying the `index-wild-selector` to a primitive JSON value (that is,
a number, a string, `true`, `false`, or `null`) selects no node.

The `index-wild-selector` behaves identically to the `dot-wild-selector`.

not including — `<end>`, while incrementing by `step`.

~~~~ abnf

S              = *B        ; optional blank space
RS             = 1*B       ; required blank space

~~~~

The `slice-selector` consists of three optional decimal integers separated by colons.

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

The `slice-selector` was inspired by the slice operator of ECMAScript
4 (ES4), which was deprecated in 2014, and that of Python.


##### Informal Introduction
{: unnumbered}

This section is non-normative.

Array indexing is a way of selecting a particular element of an array using
a 0-based index.
For example, the expression `[0]` selects the first element of a non-empty array.

Negative indices index from the end of an array.
For example, the expression `[-2]` selects the last but one element of an array with at least two elements.

Array slicing is inspired by the behavior of the `Array.prototype.slice` method
of the JavaScript language as defined by the ECMA-262 standard {{ECMA-262}},
with the addition of the `step` parameter, which is inspired by the Python slice expression.

The array slice expression `[start:end:step]` selects elements at indices starting at `start`,
incrementing by `step`, and ending with `end` (which is itself excluded).
So, for example, the expression `[1:3]` (where `step` defaults to `1`)
selects elements with indices `1` and `2` (in that order) whereas
`[1:5:2]` selects elements with indices `1` and `3`.

When `step` is negative, elements are selected in reverse order. Thus,
for example, `[5:1:-2]` selects elements with indices `5` and `3`, in
that order and `[::-1]` selects all the elements of an array in
reverse order.

When `step` is `0`, no elements are selected.
(This is the one case that differs from the behavior of Python, which
raises an error in this case.)

The following section specifies the behavior fully, without depending on
JavaScript or Python behavior.

##### Detailed Semantics
{: unnumbered}

An array selector is either an array slice or an array index, which is defined
in terms of an array slice.

A slice expression selects a subset of the elements of the input array, in
the same order
as the array or the reverse order, depending on the sign of the `step` parameter.
It selects no nodes from a node that is not an array.

A slice is defined by the two slice parameters, `start` and `end`, and
an iteration delta, `step`.
Each of these parameters is
optional. `len` is the length of the input array.

The default value for `step` is `1`.
The default values for `start` and `end` depend on the sign of `step`,
as follows:

| Condition    | start   | end      |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| step >= 0    | 0       | len      |
| step < 0     | len - 1 | -len - 1 |
{: title="Default array slice start and end values"}

Slice expression parameters `start` and `end` are not directly usable
as slice bounds and must first be normalized.
Normalization for this purpose is defined as:

~~~~
FUNCTION Normalize(i, len):
  IF i >= 0 THEN
    RETURN i
  ELSE
    RETURN len + i
  END IF
~~~~

The result of the array indexing expression `[i]` applied to an array
of length `len` is defined to be the result of the array
slicing expression `[i:Normalize(i, len)+1:1]`.

Slice expression parameters `start` and `end` are used to derive slice bounds `lower` and `upper`.
The direction of the iteration, defined
by the sign of `step`, determines which of the parameters is the lower bound and which
is the upper bound:

~~~~
FUNCTION Bounds(start, end, step, len):
  n_start = Normalize(start, len)
  n_end = Normalize(end, len)

  IF step >= 0 THEN
    lower = MIN(MAX(n_start, 0), len)
    upper = MIN(MAX(n_end, 0), len)
  ELSE
    upper = MIN(MAX(n_start, -1), len-1)
    lower = MIN(MAX(n_end, -1), len-1)
  END IF

  RETURN (lower, upper)
~~~~

The slice expression selects elements with indices between the lower and
upper bounds.
In the following pseudocode, the `a(i)` construct expresses the
0-based indexing operation on the underlying array.

~~~~
IF step > 0 THEN

  i = lower
  WHILE i < upper:
    SELECT a(i)
    i = i + step
  END WHILE

ELSE if step < 0 THEN

  i = upper
  WHILE lower < i:
    SELECT a(i)
    i = i + step
  END WHILE

END IF
~~~~

When `step = 0`, no elements are selected and the result array is empty.

To be valid, the slice expression parameters MUST be in the I-JSON
range of exact values, see {{synsem-overview}}.

### Filter Selector

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

The filter selector has the form `[?<expr>]`. It works via iterating over structured values, i.e. arrays and objects.

~~~~ abnf
filter-selector    = "[" S filter S "]"
filter             = "?" S boolean-expr
~~~~

During the iteration process each array element or object member is visited and its value — accessible via symbol `@` — or one of its descendants — uniquely defined by a relative path — is tested against a boolean expression `boolean-expr`.

The current item is selected if and only if the boolean expression yields true.


~~~~ abnf
boolean-expr     = logical-or-expr
logical-or-expr  = logical-and-expr *(S "||" S logical-and-expr)
                                                      ; disjunction
                                                      ; binds less tightly than conjunction
logical-and-expr = basic-expr *(S "&&" S basic-expr)  ; conjunction
                                                      ; binds more tightly than disjunction

basic-expr        = exist-expr /
                    paren-expr /
                    relation-expr
exist-expr        = [logical-not-op S] singular-path  ; path existence or non-existence
~~~~

Paths in filter expressions are Singular Paths, each of which selects at most one node.

~~~~ abnf
singular-path     = rel-singular-path / abs-singular-path
rel-singular-path = "@" *(S (dot-selector / index-selector))
abs-singular-path = root-selector *(S (dot-selector / index-selector))
~~~~

Parentheses can be used with `boolean-expr` for grouping. So filter selection syntax in the original proposal `[?(<expr>)]` is naturally contained in the current lean syntax `[?<expr>]` as a special case.

~~~~ abnf
paren-expr        = [logical-not-op S] "(" S boolean-expr S ")"
                                                      ; parenthesized expression
logical-not-op    = "!"                               ; logical NOT operator

relation-expr = comp-expr /                           ; comparison test
                regex-expr                            ; regular expression test
~~~~

Comparisons are restricted to Singular Path values and primitive values (that is, numbers, strings, `true`, `false`,
and `null`).

~~~~ abnf
comp-expr    = comparable S comp-op S comparable
comparable   = number / string-literal /              ; primitive ...
               true / false / null /                  ; values only
               singular-path                          ; Singular Path value
comp-op      = "==" / "!=" /                          ; comparison ...
               "<"  / ">"  /                          ; operators
               "<=" / ">="
~~~~

Alphabetic characters in ABNF are case-insensitive, so "e" can be either "e" or "E".

`true`, `false`, and `null` are lower-case only (case-sensitive).

~~~~ abnf
number       = int [ frac ] [ exp ]                   ; decimal number

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

The `filter-selector` works with arrays and objects exclusively. Its result is a list of *zero*, *one*, *multiple* or *all* of their array elements or member values, respectively.
Applied to other value types, it will select nothing.

A relative path, beginning with `@`, refers to the current array element or member value as the
filter selector iterates over the array or object.

##### Existence Tests
{: unnumbered}

A singular path by itself in a Boolean context is an existence test which yields true if the path selects a node and yields false if the path does not select a node.
This existence test — as an exception to the general rule — also works with nodes with structured values.

To test the value of a node selected by a path, an explicit comparison is necessary.
For example, to test whether the node selected by the path `@.foo` has the value `null`, use `@.foo == null` (see {{null-semantics}})
rather than the negated existence test `!@.foo` (which yields false if `@.foo` selects a node, regardless of the node's value).

##### Comparisons
{: unnumbered}

The comparison operators `==`, `<`, and `>` are defined first and then these are used to define `!=`, `<=`, and `>=`.

When a path resulting in an empty nodelist appears on either side of a comparison:

* a comparison using the operator `==` yields true if and only if the comparison
is between two paths each of which result in an empty nodelist.

* a comparison using either of the operators `<` or `>` yields false.

When any path on either side of a comparison results in a nodelist consisting of a single node, each such path is
replaced by the value of its node and then:

* a comparison using the operator `==` yields true if and only if the comparison
is between:
    * values of the same primitive type (numbers, strings, booleans, and `null`) which are equal,
    * equal arrays, that is arrays of the same length where each element of the first array is equal to the corresponding
      element of the second array, or
    * equal objects with no duplicate names, that is where:
        * both objects have the same collection of names (with no duplicates), and
        * for each of those names, the values associated with the name by the objects are equal.

* a comparison using either of the operators `<` or `>` yields true if and only if
the comparison is between values of the same type which are both numbers or both strings and which satisfy the comparison:

    * numbers expected to interoperate as per {{Section 2.2 of -i-json (I-JSON)}} MUST compare using the normal mathematical ordering;
      numbers not expected to interoperate as per I-JSON MAY compare using an implementation specific ordering
    * the empty string compares less than any non-empty string
    * a non-empty string compares less than another non-empty string if and only if the first string starts with a
      lower Unicode scalar value than the second string or if both strings start with the same Unicode scalar value and
      the remainder of the first string compares less than the remainder of the second string.

Note that comparisons using either of the operators `<` or `>` yield false if either value being
compared is an object, array, boolean, or `null`.

`!=`, `<=` and `>=` are defined in terms of the other comparison operators. For any `a` and `b`:

* The comparison `a != b` yields true if and only if `a == b` yields false.
* The comparison `a <= b` yields true if and only if `a < b` yields true or `a == b` yields true.
* The comparison `a >= b` yields true if and only if `a > b` yields true or `a == b` yields true.

### List Selector

The list selector allows combining member names, array indices,
slices, and filters in a single selector.

Note: The list selector was called "union selector" in
{{JSONPath-orig}}, as it was intended to solve use cases addressed by
the union selector in XPath.
However, the term "union" has the connotation of a set operation that involves
merging input sets while avoiding duplicates, so the concept was
renamed into "list selector".

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

The list selector is syntactically related to the
`dot-selector`, `index-selector`, `slice-selector`, and the `filter-selector`.
It contains two or more entries, separated by commas.

~~~~ abnf
list-selector  = "[" S list-entry 1*(S "," S list-entry) S "]"

list-entry     =  ( quoted-member-name /
                    element-index      /
                    slice-index /
                    filter
                  )
~~~~

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

A list selector selects the nodes that are selected by
the selector entries in the list and yields the concatenation of the
lists (in the order of the selector entries) of nodes selected by the
selector entries.
Note that any node selected in more than one of the selector entries is kept
as many times in the nodelist.

To be valid, integer values in the `element-index` and `slice-index`
components MUST be in the I-JSON {{-i-json}} range of exact values, see
{{synsem-overview}}.


#### Examples
{: unnumbered}

JSON:

    ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", {"n": "v", "o": "w", "p": "x"}]

{: title="List selector examples"}

### Descendant Selectors

#### Syntax
{: unnumbered}

The descendant selectors start with a double dot `..` and can be
followed by an object member name (similar to the `dot-selector`),
a wildcard (similar to the `dot-wild-selector`),
an `index-selector`, `index-wild-selector`, `filter-selector`, or `list-selector` acting on objects or arrays,
or a `slice-selector` acting on arrays.

~~~~ abnf
descendant-selector = ".." ( dot-member-name      /  ; ..<name>
                             wildcard             /  ; ..*
                             index-selector       /  ; ..[<index>]
                             index-wild-selector  /  ; ..[*]
                             slice-selector       /  ; ..[<slice-index>]
                             filter-selector      /  ; ..[<filter>]
                             list-selector           ; ..[<list-entry>,...]
                           )
~~~~

Note that `..` on its own is not a valid selector.

#### Semantics
{: unnumbered}

A descendant selector selects zero or more descendants of a node.

The resultant nodelist of a descendant selector is the result of applying a selector,
depending on the variant of the descendant selector, to a
nodelist enumerating the node and its descendants such that:

* nodes of any array appear in array order,
* nodes appear immediately before all their descendants.

This definition does not stipulate the order in which the children of an object appear, since
JSON objects are unordered.

The selector to apply is shown below:

| Variant | Selector to apply | Comment |
| :---: | :---: | ------- |
| `..<name>` | `.<name>`| [Dot selector](#dot-selector)  |
| `..*` | `.*` | All descendants |
| `..[<name>]` | `[<name>]`| [Index selector](#index-selector) |
| `..[*]` | `.[*]` | All descendants |
| `..[<slice-index>]` | `[<slice-index>]` | [Array slice selector](#slice) |
| `..[<filter>]` | `[<filter>]` | [Filter selector](#filter-selector) |
| `..[<list-entry>,...]` | `[<list-entry>,...]` | [List selector](#list-selector) |

    {
      "o": {"j": 1, "k": 2},
      "a": [5, 3, [{"j": 4}]]
    }

Queries:

| Query | Result | Result Paths | Comment |
| :---: | ------ | :----------: | ------- |
| `$..j`   | `1` <br> `4` | `$['o']['j']` <br> `$['a'][2][0]['j']` | Object values      |
| `$..j`   | `4` <br> `1` | `$['a'][2][0]['j']` <br> `$['o']['j']` | Alternative result |
| `$..[0]` | `5` <br> `{"j": 4}` | `$['a'][0]` <br> `$['a'][2][0]` | Array values       |
| `$..[0]` | `{"j": 4}` <br> `5` | `$['a'][2][0]` <br> `$['a'][0]` | Alternative result |
| `$..[*]` <br> `$..*` | `{"j": 1, "k" : 2}` <br> `[5, 3, [{"j": 4}]]` <br> `1` <br> `2` <br> `5` <br> `3` <br> `[{"j": 4}]` <br> `{"j": 4}` <br> `4` | `$['o']` <br> `$['a']` <br> `$['o']['j']` <br> `$['o']['k']` <br> `$['a'][0]` <br> `$['a'][1]` <br> `$['a'][2]` <br> `$['a'][2][0]` <br> `$['a'][2][0]['j']` | All values    |
| `$..o`   | `{"j": 1, "k": 2}` | `$['o']` | Reflexive descendant nodelist includes input value |
{: title="Descendant selector examples"}

Note: The ordering of the results for the `$..[*]` and `$..*` examples above is not guaranteed, except that:

* `{"j": 1, "k": 2}` must appear before `1` and `2`,
* `[5, 3, [{"j": 4}]]` must appear before `5`, `3`, and `[{"j": 4}]`,
* `5` must appear before `3` which must appear before `[{"j": 4}]`,
* `5` and `3` must appear before `{"j": 4}` and `4`,
* `[{"j": 4}]` must appear before `{"j": 4}`, and
* `{"j": 4}` must appear before `4`.

## Semantics of `null` {#null-semantics}

Note that JSON `null` is treated the same as any other JSON value: it is not taken to mean "undefined" or "missing".

### Examples

| `$.b[?@==null]` | `null` | `$['b'][0]` | Comparison |
| `$.c[?(@.d==null)]` | | | Comparison with "missing" value |
| `$.null` | `1` | `$['null']` | Not JSON null at all, just a string as object key |
{: title="Examples involving (or not involving) null"}

## Normalized Paths

A Normalized Path is a JSONPath with restricted syntax that identifies a node by providing a query that results in exactly that node. For example,
the JSONPath expression `$.book[?(@.price<10)]` could select two values with Normalized Paths
`$['book'][3]` and `$['book'][5]`. For a given JSON value, there is a one to one correspondence between the value's
nodes and the Normalized Paths that identify these nodes.

A JSONPath implementation may output Normalized Paths instead of, or in addition to, the values identified by these paths.

Since bracket notation is more general than dot notation, it is used to construct Normalized Paths.
Single quotes are used to delimit string member names. This reduces the number of characters that
need escaping when Normalized Paths appear as strings (which are delimited with double quotes) in JSON texts.

Certain characters are escaped, in one and only one way; all other characters are unescaped.

Normalized Paths are Singular Paths. Not all Singular Paths are Normalized Paths: `$[-3]`, for example, is a Singular
Path, but not a Normalized Path.

# Security Considerations {#Security}

Security considerations for JSONPath can stem from

* attack vectors on JSONPath implementations, and
* the way JSONPath is used in security-relevant mechanisms.

## Attack vectors on JSONPath Implementations

Historically, JSONPath has often been implemented by feeding parts of
the query to an underlying programming language engine, e.g.,
JavaScript.
This approach is well known to lead to injection attacks and would
require perfect input validation to prevent these attacks (see
{{Section 12 of -json}} for similar considerations for JSON itself).
Instead, JSONPath implementations need to implement the entire syntax
of the query without relying on the parsers of programming language
engines.

Attacks on availability may attempt to trigger unusually expensive
runtime performance exhibited by certain implementations in certain
cases.
(See {{Section 10 of -cbor}} for issues in hash-table implementations,
and {{Section 8 of -iregexp}} for performance issues in regular
expression implementations.)
Implementers need to be aware that good average performance is not
sufficient as long as an attacker can choose to submit specially
crafted JSONPath queries or arguments that trigger surprisingly high, possibly
exponential, CPU usage or, for example via a naive recursive implementation of the descendant selector,
stack overflow. Implementations need to have appropriate resource management
to mitigate these attacks.

## Attacks on Security Mechanisms that Employ JSONPath

Where JSONPath is used as a part of a security mechanism, attackers
can attempt to provoke unexpected or unpredictable behavior, or
take advantage of differences in behavior between JSONPath implementations.

Unexpected or unpredictable behavior can arise from an argument with certain
constructs described as unpredictable by {{-json}}.
Predictable behavior can be expected, except in relation to the ordering
of objects, for any argument conforming with {{-i-json}}.

Other attacks can target the behavior of underlying technologies such as UTF-8 (see
{{Section 10 of -utf8}}) and the Unicode character set.

# Inspired by XPath

This appendix is informative.

At the time JSONPath was invented, XML was noted for the availability of
powerful tools to analyze, transform and selectively extract data from
XML documents.
{{XPath}} is one of these tools.

In 2007, the need for something solving the same class of problems for
the emerging JSON community became apparent, specifically for:

* Finding data interactively and extracting them out of {{-json}}
  JSON values without special scripting.
* Specifying the relevant parts of the JSON data in a request by a
  client, so the server can reduce the amount of data in its response,
  minimizing bandwidth usage.

(Note that XPath has evolved since 2007, and recent versions even
nominally support operating inside JSON values.
This appendix only discusses the more widely used version of XPath
that was available in 2007.)

JSONPath picks up the overall feeling of XPath, but maps the concepts
to syntax (and partially semantics) that would be familiar to someone
using JSON in a dynamic language.

E.g., in popular dynamic programming languages such as JavaScript,
Python and PHP, the semantics of the XPath expression

x.store.book[0].title
~~~~

or, in bracket notation,

~~~~
x['store']['book'][0]['title']
~~~~

with the variable x holding the argument.

The JSONPath language was designed to:

* be naturally based on those language characteristics;
* cover only the most essential parts of XPath 1.0;
* be lightweight in code size and memory consumption;
* be runtime efficient.

## JSONPath and XPath {#xpath-overview}

JSONPath expressions apply to JSON values in the same way
as XPath expressions are used in combination with an XML document.
JSONPath uses `$` to refer to the root node of the argument, similar
to XPath's `/` at the front.

JSONPath expressions move further down the hierarchy using *dot notation*
(`$.store.book[0].title`)
or the *bracket notation*
(`$['store']['book'][0]['title']`), a lightweight/limited, and a more
heavyweight syntax replacing XPath's `/` within query expressions.

Both JSONPath and XPath use `*` for a wildcard.
The descendant operators, starting with `..`, borrowed from {{E4X}}, are similar to XPath's `//`.
The array slicing construct `[start:end:step]` is unique to JSONPath,
inspired by {{SLICE}} from ECMASCRIPT 4.

Filter expressions are supported via the syntax `?(<boolean expr>)` as in

~~~~
$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title
~~~~

{: #tbl-xpath-equivalents title="Example XPath expressions and their JSONPath equivalents"}

XPath has a lot more functionality (location paths in unabbreviated syntax,
operators and functions) than listed in this comparison.  Moreover, there are
significant differences in how the subscript operator works in XPath and
JSONPath:

* Square brackets in XPath expressions always operate on the *node
  set* resulting from the previous path fragment. Indices always start
  at 1.
* With JSONPath, square brackets operate on the *object* or *array*
  addressed by the previous path fragment. Array indices always start
  at 0.

# JSON Pointer

This appendix is informative.

JSONPath is not intended as a replacement for, but as a more powerful
companion to, JSON Pointer {{RFC6901}}. The purposes of the two standards
are different.

JSON Pointer is for identifying a single value within a JSON value whose
structure is known.

JSONPath can identify a single value within a JSON value, for example by
using a Normalized Path. But JSONPath is also a query syntax that can be used
to search for and extract multiple values from JSON values whose structure
is known only in a general way.

A Normalized JSONPath can be converted into a JSON Pointer by converting the syntax,
without knowledge of any JSON value. The inverse is not generally true: a numeric
path component in a JSON Pointer may identify a member of a JSON object or may index an array.
For conversion to a JSONPath query, knowledge of the structure of the JSON value is
needed to distinguish these cases.
