# Introduction

This document picks up the popular JSONPath specification dated
2007-02-21 {{JSONPath-orig}} and provides a normative definition for it.
In its current state, it is a strawman document showing what needs to
be covered.

JSON is defined by {{RFC8259}}.

JSONPath is not intended as a replacement, but as a more powerful
companion, to JSON Pointer {{RFC6901}}. \[insert reference to section
where the relationship is detailed.  The purposes of the two syntaxes
are different. Pointer is for isolating a single location within a
document. Path is a query syntax that can also be used to pull multiple locations.]


## Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as ABNF,
as described in {{-abnf}}.
ABNF terminal values in this document define Unicode code points rather than
their UTF-8 encoding.
For example, the Unicode PLACE OF INTEREST SIGN (U+2318) would be defined
in ABNF as `%x2318`.

The terminology of {{-json}} applies, including definitions for
"Value", "Object", "Array", "Number", and "String".
Additional terms used in this specification are defined below.
Importantly "object" and "array" in particular do not take on a
generic meaning, such as they would in a general programming context.

For the purposes of this specification, a Value as defined by
{{-json}} is also viewed as a tree of nodes.
Each node, in turn, holds a Value.
Further nodes within the Value are the elements of arrays and the
member values of JSON objects contained in the Value and are
themselves Values.
(The type of the Value held by a node is
may also be referred to as the type of the node.)

A JSONPath query is applied to a Value that is supplied to it as
its Argument.
The node referring to the entirety of this Value is also
referred to as its root node.

Node:
: A Value, with an emphasis on its location within the
  Argument.  I.e., a Value that is identical to or contained within the JSON
  value to which the query is applied.  A node can be viewed as a
  combination of a (1) Value and (2) its location in the
  Argument; the latter can, if desired, be represented as an Output Path.

Member:
: A name/value pair in a JSON object.  (Not itself a Value.)

Name:
: The name in a name/value pair constituting a member.  (Also known as
  "key", "tag", or "label".)

Element:
: A Value in an array.  (Also used with a distinct meaning in XML
  context for XML elements.)

Index:
: A non-negative integer that identifies a specific element in an array.
  The term, in particular in the form indexing, is also sometimes used
  for either an index or a member name, when both arrays and objects
  can be fed to the indexing operation.

Query:
: Short name for JSONPath expression.

Argument:
: Short name for the Value a JSONPath expression is applied to.

Nodelist:
: Output of applying a query to an argument: a list of nodes within
  that argument.
  While this list can be represented in JSON, e.g. as an array, the
  nodelist is an abstract concept unrelated to JSON values.

Output Path:
: A simple form of JSONPath expression that identifies a node by
  providing a query that results in exactly that node.  Similar
  to, but syntactically different from, a JSON Pointer {{-pointer}}.


## Inspired by XPath

A frequently emphasized advantage of XML is the availability of
powerful tools to analyse, transform and selectively extract data from
XML documents.
{{XPath}} is one of these tools.

In 2007, the need for something solving the same class of problems for
the emerging JSON community became apparent, specifically for:

* Finding data interactively and extracting them out of {{-json}}
  JSON values without special scripting.
* Specifying the relevant parts of the JSON data in a request by a
  client, so the server can reduce the amount of data in its response,
  minimizing bandwidth usage.

So what does such a tool look like for JSON?
When defining a JSONPath, how should expressions look?

The XPath expression

~~~~
/store/book[1]/title
~~~~

looks like

~~~~
x.store.book[0].title
~~~~

or

~~~~
x['store']['book'][0]['title']
~~~~

in popular programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and PHP,
with a variable x holding the Value.  Here we observe that
such languages already have a fundamentally XPath-like feature built
in.

The JSONPath tool in question should:

* be naturally based on those language characteristics.
* cover only essential parts of XPath 1.0.
* be lightweight in code size and memory consumption.
* be runtime efficient.

## Overview of JSONPath Expressions {#overview}

JSONPath expressions always apply to a Value in the same way
as XPath expressions are used in combination with an XML document.
Since a Value is anonymous, JSONPath uses the abstract name `$` to
refer to the entire Value ("root node") of the argument.

JSONPath expressions can use the *dot–notation*

~~~~
$.store.book[0].title
~~~~

or the *bracket–notation*

~~~~
$['store']['book'][0]['title']
~~~~

for paths input to a JSONPath processor.
\[1]
Where a JSONPath processor uses JSONPath expressions as output paths,
these will always be converted to Output Paths
which employ the more general *bracket–notation*.
\[2]
Bracket notation is more general than dot notation and can serve as a
canonical form when a JSONPath processor uses JSONPath expressions as
output paths.


JSONPath allows the wildcard symbol `*` for member names and array
indices. It borrows the descendant operator `..` from {{E4X}} and
the array slice syntax proposal `[start:end:step]` {{SLICE}} from ECMASCRIPT 4.

JSONPath was originally designed to employ an *underlying scripting
language* for computing expressions.  The present specification
defines a simple expression language that is independent from any
scripting language in use on the platform.

JSONPath can use expressions, written in parentheses: `(<expr>)`, as
an alternative to explicit names or indices as in:

~~~~
$.store.book[(@.length-1)].title
~~~~

The symbol `@` is used for the current node.
Filter expressions are supported via the syntax `?(<boolean expr>)` as in

~~~~
$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title
~~~~

Here is a complete overview and a side by side comparison of the JSONPath syntax elements with their XPath counterparts.

{: #tbl-overview title="Overview over JSONPath, comparing to XPath"}

<!-- note that the weirdness about the vertical bar above is intentional -->

XPath has a lot more to offer (location paths in unabbreviated syntax,
operators and functions) than listed here.  Moreover there is a
significant difference how the subscript operator works in Xpath and
JSONPath:

* Square brackets in XPath expressions always operate on the *node set* resulting from the previous path fragment. Indices always start at 1.
* With JSONPath, square brackets operate on the *object* or *array*
  addressed by the previous path fragment. Array indices always start at 0.

# JSONPath Examples

This section provides some more examples for JSONPath expressions.
The examples are based on the simple Value shown in
{{fig-example-value}}, which was patterned after a
typical XML example representing a bookstore (that also has bicycles).

# JSONPath Syntax and Semantics

## Overview {#synsem-overview}

A JSONPath is a string which selects zero or more nodes of a piece of JSON.
A valid JSONPath conforms to the ABNF syntax defined by this document.

A JSONPath MUST be encoded using UTF-8. To parse a JSONPath according to
the grammar in this document, its UTF-8 form SHOULD first be decoded into
Unicode code points as described
in {{RFC3629}}.

A string to be used as a JSONPath query needs to be *well-formed* and
*valid*.
A string is a well-formed JSONPath query if it conforms to the syntax
of JSONPath.
A well-formed JSONPath query is valid if it also fulfills all semantic
requirements posed by this document.

The well-formedness and the validity of JSONPath queries are independent of
the Value the query is applied to; no further errors can be
raised during application of the query to a Value.

(Obviously, an implementation can still fail when executing a JSONPath
query, e.g., because of resource depletion, but this is not modeled in
the present specification.)

> Discussion (D1): are we ready for the error model defined here, i.e. one
> that does not have runtime errors, but only compile time errors?

## Processing Model

In this specification, the semantics of a JSONPath query are defined
in terms of a *processing model*.  That model is not prescriptive of
the internal workings of an implementation:  Implementations may wish
(or need) to design a different process that yields results that
conform to the model.

In the processing model,
a valid JSONPath query is executed against a Value, the *Argument*, and
produces a list of zero or more nodes of the Value which are
selected by the JSONPath.
(Note that the term Value also implies that this value complies
to the definitions in {{-json}}, i.e., is indeed a Value.)

The JSONPath query is a sequence of zero or more *selectors*, each of
which is applied to the result of the previous selector and provides
input to the next selector.
These results and inputs take the form of a *nodelist*, i.e., a
sequence of zero or more nodes.

The nodelist going into the first selector contains a single node,
holding the Argument.
The nodelist resulting from the last selector is presented as the
result of the query; depending on the specific API, it might be
presented as an array of the JSON values at the nodes, an array of
Output Paths referencing the nodes, or both — or some other
representation as desired by the implementation.
Note that the API must be capable of presenting an empty nodelist as
the result of the query.

A selector performs its function on each of the nodes in its input
nodelist, during such a function execution, such a node is referred to
as "current node".  Each of these function executions produces a
result nodelist, which are then combined by algorithm *combine1* into
the result of the selector.

> Discussion (D2): We haven't decided yet whether there is only one
> *combine1* or a choice, with for instance simple concatenation and
> concatenation with duplicate removal, based on a definition of
> duplicate, are candidates.

The processing within a selector may execute nested JSONPath queries,
which are in turn handled with the processing model defined here.
Typically, the argument to that query will be the current node of the
selector or a set of nodes subordinate to that current node.


## Syntax

Syntactically, a JSONPath consists of a root selector (`$`), which
stands for a nodelist that contains the root node of the Argument,
followed by a possibly empty sequence of *selectors*.

~~~~ abnf
json-path = root-selector *selector
root-selector = "$"               ; $ selects document root node
~~~~

The syntax and semantics of each selector is defined below.


## Semantics

The root selector `$` not only selects the root node of the input
document, but it also produces as output a list consisting of one
node: the input Value.

A selector may select zero or more nodes for further processing.
A syntactically valid selector MUST NOT produce errors.
This means that some
operations which might be considered erroneous, such as indexing beyond the
end of an array,
simply result in fewer nodes being selected.

But a selector doesn't just act on a single node: a selector acts on
each of the nodes in its input nodelist and selects an output
nodelist for each of them, as follows, which are then combined using
the combine1 algorithm to form the result nodelist of the selector.

> Discussion (D3): Do we allow selectors that have their own combine1
> variant, or can we always use the same?

For each node in the list, the selector selects zero or more nodes,
each of which is a descendant of the node or the node itself.

> Discussion (D4): Is that a common requirement?  Or can a selector also go
> up, or to the query Argument?

For instance, with the Argument `{"a":[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"c":2}]}`, the
JSONPath `$.a[*].b` selects the following list of nodes: `0`, `1`
(denoted here by their value).
Let's walk through this in detail.

The JSONPath consists of `$` followed by three selectors: `.a`, `[*]`, and `.b`.

Firstly, `$` selects the root node which is the input document.
So the result is a list consisting of just the root node.

Next, `.a` selects from any input node of type object and selects any value of the input
node corresponding to the member name `"a"`.
The result is again a list of one node: `[{"b":0},{"b":1},{"c":2}]`.

Next, `[*]` selects from any input node which is an array and selects all the elements
of the input node.
The result is a list of three nodes: `{"b":0}`, `{"b":1}`, and `{"c":2}`.

Finally, `.b` selects from any input node of type object with a member name
`b` and selects the value of the input node corresponding to that name.
The result is a list containing `0`, `1`.
This is the concatenation of three lists, two of length one containing
`0`, `1`, respectively, and one of length zero.

As a consequence of this approach, if any of the selectors selects no nodes,
then the whole JSONPath selects no nodes.

In what follows, the semantics of each selector are defined for each type
of node.


## Selectors

### Dot Child Selector

#### Syntax
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

A dot child selector has a member name known as a dot child name or a single asterisk
(`*`).

A dot child name corresponds to a name in a object.

~~~~ abnf
selector = dot-child              ; see below for alternatives
dot-child = "." dot-child-name / ; .<dot-child-name>
            "." "*"             ; .*
dot-child-name = 1*(

~~~~

More general child names, such as the empty string, are supported by "Union
Child" ({{unionchild}}{: format="default"}).

Note that the `dot-child-name` rule follows the philosophy of JSON strings and is
allowed to contain bit sequences that cannot encode Unicode characters (a
single unpaired UTF-16 surrogate, for example).
The behaviour of an implementation is undefined for child names which do
not encode Unicode characters.


#### Semantics
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

A dot child name which is not a single asterisk (`*`) is considered to
have a member name.
It selects the value corresponding to the name from any object node.
It selects
no nodes from a node which is not a object.

The member name of a dot child name is the sequence of Unicode characters contained
in that name.

A dot child name consisting of a single asterisk is a wild card. It selects
all the values of any object node.
It also selects all the elements of any array node.
It selects no nodes from
number, string, or literal nodes.



### Union Selector

#### Syntax

A union selector consists of one or more union elements.

~~~~ abnf
selector =/ union
union = "[" ws union-elements ws "]" ; [...]
ws = *" "                             ; zero or more spaces
union-elements = union-element /
                 union-element ws "," ws union-elements
                                       ; ,-separated list
~~~~


#### Semantics

A union selects any node which is selected by at least one of the union selectors
and selects the concatenation of the
lists (in the order of the selectors) of nodes selected by the union elements.<!--  TODO: define whether duplicates are kept or removed.  -->


#### Child {#unionchild}

##### Syntax
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

A child is a quoted string.

~~~~ abnf
union-element = child ; see below for more alternatives
child = %x22 *double-quoted %x22 / ; "string"
        "'" *single-quoted "'"   ; 'string'

double-quoted = dq-unescaped /
          escape (
              %x22 /         ; "    quotation mark  U+0022
              "/" /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
              "\" /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C
              "b" /          ; b    backspace       U+0008
              "f" /          ; f    form feed       U+000C

              "t" /          ; t    tab             U+0009
              "u" 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX


dq-unescaped = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-10FFFF

single-quoted = sq-unescaped /
          escape (
              "'" /          ; '    apostrophe      U+0027
              "/" /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
              "\" /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C

              "r" /          ; r    carriage return U+000D
              "t" /          ; t    tab             U+0009
              "u" 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX

sq-unescaped = %x20-26 / %x28-5B / %x5D-10FFFF

escape = "\"                 ; \

HEXDIG =  DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"
                              ; case insensitive hex digit
~~~~

Notes:
1. double-quoted strings follow JSON in {{RFC8259}}.
   Single-quoted strings follow an analogous pattern.
2. `HEXDIG` includes A-F and a-f.


##### Semantics
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

If the child is a quoted string, the string MUST be converted to a
member name by removing the surrounding quotes and
replacing each escape sequence with its equivalent Unicode character, as
in the table below:

| Escape Sequence   | Unicode Character   |
| :---------------: | :-----------------: |
| "\\" %x22          | U+0022              |
| "\\" "'"           | U+0027              |
| "\\" "/"           | U+002F              |
| "\\" "\\"          | U+005C              |
| "\\" "b"           | U+0008              |
| "\\" "f"           | U+000C              |
| "\\" "n"           | U+000A              |
| "\\" "r"           | U+000D              |
| "\\" "t"           | U+0009              |
| "\\" uXXXX         | U+XXXX              |
{: title="Escape Sequence Replacements" cols="c c"}

The child selects the value corresponding to the member name from any object
node that has a member with that name.
It selects no nodes from a node which is not a object.



#### Array Selector

##### Syntax
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

An array selector selects zero or more elements of an array node.
An array selector takes the form of an index, which selects at most one element,
or a slice, which selects zero or more elements.

~~~~ abnf
union-element =/ array-index / array-slice
~~~~

An array index is an integer (in base 10).

~~~~ abnf
array-index = integer

integer = ["-"] ("0" / (DIGIT1 *DIGIT))
                            ; optional - followed by 0 or
                            ; sequence of digits with no leading zero
DIGIT1 = %x31-39            ; non-zero digit
~~~~

Note: the syntax does not allow integers with leading zeros such as `01` and `-01`.

An array slice consists of three optional integers (in base 10) separated by colons.

~~~~ abnf
array-slice = [ start ] ws ":" ws [ end ]
                   [ ws ":" ws [ step ] ]
start = integer
end = integer
step = integer
~~~~

Note: the array slices `:` and `::` are both syntactically valid, as are `:2:2`, `2::2`, and `2:4:`.

##### Semantics

###### Informal Introduction
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

This section is non-normative.

Array indexing is a way of selecting a particular element of an array using
a 0-based index.
For example, the expression `[0]` selects the first element of a non-empty array.

Negative indices index from the end of an array.
For example, the expression `[-2]` selects the last but one element of an array with at least two elements.

Array slicing is inspired by the behaviour of the `Array.prototype.slice` method
of the JavaScript language as defined by the ECMA-262 standard {{ECMA-262}},
with the addition of the `step` parameter, which is inspired by the Python slice expression.

The array slice expression `[start:end:step]` selects elements at indices starting at `start`,
incrementing by `step`, and ending with `end` (which is itself excluded).
So, for example, the expression `[1:3]` (where `step` defaults to `1`)
selects elements with indices `1` and `2` (in that order) whereas
`[1:5:2]` selects elements with indices `1` and `3`.

When `step` is negative, elements are selected in reverse order. Thus,
for example, `[5:1:-2]` selects elements with indices `5` and `3`, in
that order and `[::-1]` selects all the elements of an array in
reverse order.

When `step` is `0`, no elements are selected.
This is the one case which differs from the behaviour of Python, which
raises an error in this case.

The following section specifies the behaviour fully, without depending on
JavaScript or Python behaviour.


###### Detailed Semantics
{: numbered="false" toc="exclude"}

An array selector is either an array slice or an array index, which is defined
in terms of an array slice.

A slice expression selects a subset of the elements of the input array, in
the same order
as the array or the reverse order, depending on the sign of the `step` parameter.
It selects no nodes from a node which is not an array.

A slice is defined by the two slice parameters, `start` and `end`, and
an iteration delta, `step`.
Each of these parameters is
optional. `len` is the length of the input array.

The default value for `step` is `1`.
The default values for `start` and `end` depend on the sign of `step`,
as follows:

| Condition    | start   | end      |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| step >= 0    | 0       | len      |
| step < 0     | len - 1 | -len - 1 |
{: title="Default array slice start and end values"}

Slice expression parameters `start` and `end` are not directly usable
as slice bounds and must first be normalized.
Normalization for this purpose is defined as:

~~~~
FUNCTION Normalize(i, len):
  IF i >= 0 THEN
    RETURN i
  ELSE
    RETURN len + i
  END IF
~~~~

The result of the array indexing expression `[i]` applied to an array
of length `len` is defined to be the result of the array
slicing expression `[i:Normalize(i, len)+1:1]`.

Slice expression parameters `start` and `end` are used to derive slice bounds `lower` and `upper`.
The direction of the iteration, defined
by the sign of `step`, determines which of the parameters is the lower bound and which
is the upper bound:

~~~~
FUNCTION Bounds(start, end, step, len):
  n_start = Normalize(start, len)
  n_end = Normalize(end, len)

  IF step >= 0 THEN
    lower = MIN(MAX(n_start, 0), len)
    upper = MIN(MAX(n_end, 0), len)
  ELSE
    upper = MIN(MAX(n_start, -1), len-1)
    lower = MIN(MAX(n_end, -1), len-1)
  END IF

  RETURN (lower, upper)
~~~~

The slice expression selects elements with indices between the lower and
upper bounds.
In the following pseudocode, the `a(i)` construct expresses the
0-based indexing operation on the underlying array.

~~~~
IF step > 0 THEN

  i = lower
  WHILE i < upper:
    SELECT a(i)
    i = i + step
  END WHILE

ELSE if step < 0 THEN

  i = upper
  WHILE lower < i:
    SELECT a(i)
    i = i + step
  END WHILE

END IF
~~~~

When `step = 0`, no elements are selected and the result array is empty.

An implementation MUST raise an error if any of the slice expression parameters
does not fit in
the implementation's representation of an integer.
If a successfully parsed slice expression is evaluated against an array whose
size doesn't
fit in the implementation's representation of an integer, the implementation
MUST raise an error.
